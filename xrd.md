# XRD

goal for tonight: write about XRR and XRD in masters report
updated goal: only focus on what is necessary to understand xrr and organize somewhere else what im not trying to understand in more depth, whats relevant right now is usefulness

goal: understand the xrd system, understand what the alignmnent does, understand what yuming did, understand 0D detector, understand xrr and the data obtained by xrr, the meaning of the data and what i can estimate, understanding the physical compoenents used in the xrd

so whats important is understanding how the components are installed to give good data, what is the ideal system which is experimentally tried to be achieved
what determines the resolution?

todo:
- look at protoxrd emails
- look at yuming emails
- look at grazing xrd

## XRR notes
todo:
- map out the system and the parameters
- look at the bragg reflection equation and understand what it means 
- look at johns email to know what to answer as questions
- build graph of the applications of XRD, i.e. how the xrd relates to information can probe about a sample (different types of samples: crystal, powder, thin film, etc)
- look at videos for xrr alignment
1. incident optics-->Soller slit, focusing circle
2. detector and ROI
3. receiving optics (see 2.6.4 in hardware manual, the RS position width determines the resolution)
4. list all xrd parameters
5. xrr theory and setup

1. optics
2. detector
3. alignment/calibration
4. grazing incidence
5. xrr theory

careful not to dig to deep in useless part

* why does the beam reflect of the sample? (index of refraction, density of sample)
* xrd for thin films vs crystals
* missing what the intensity is proportional to in xrd-->see structure factor
* see if there is not some simulation i can do of xrd peaks
* what are the features of the data? (intensity, angle, gaussian shape, etc)
* need to mention specifically what i do with the model im using
* what is diffraction? (xrd==x-ray diffraction) 
	* why is it that diffractions requires the wavelength to be of the order of the slit? (missing a conceptual and physical understanding), it has to do with diffraction, so need to better understand diffraction
	* 
* why use x-rays? 
* why the peaks have a width, why not delta-fcn?
* what is the photon energy of the x-rays important for?
* what do the x-rays interact with when they are reflected?, matter interaction, type of scattering involved
* why em wave must have a wavelength at least as short as the interatomic distance for probing a crystal?
* whats the reason for the order of the optics? what if swapped DS and SS?
* why does light diverges? 

* is the role of the optics to bring the x-ray beam closer to its ideal case?

**levels of abstraction**
light-matter interaction
bragg equation level of understanding (see A&M)

structure for xrd experiments:
- approximation of bragg peaks using bragg equation (substrate and film)
- finding reference of xrd data

**Calculations, estimations and approximations**
- calculation of beam divergence using $\alpha = \frac{D+S}{L}$ (see notes)

masters report:
- starting from xrd machine, describe the functionning of the xrd machine, describe how data are acquired, describe what the data means
