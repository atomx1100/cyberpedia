# RvT

**Goal**

to understand RvT, i need to understand the AC resistance bridge and the type of measurement performed

todo:
- look in white notebook for questions to answer
- map out RvT system
- understand how the scanner work, what pins need to be provided current and voltage
- finding the basic concepts from which everything follows and building mental constructions of these concepts
- memorize the functioning of the ac resistance bridge 370

tentative plan:
1. thenevin+northon thm
2. source transformation
3. ac current features
4. impedance, input/output impedance
5. lock-in amplifier

**Questions**
- whats the difference between the amplification in a lock-in amplifier and an amplifier?
