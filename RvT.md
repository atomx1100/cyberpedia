# RvT

**Goal**

to understand RvT, i need to understand the AC resistance bridge and the type of measurement performed
think about what i can add in my masters report

1. northon+find basic patterns
2. apply to what im doing
3. memorize rvt system
 

todo:
- look in white notebook for questions to answer
- map out RvT system
- understand how the scanner work, what pins need to be provided current and voltage
- finding the basic concepts from which everything follows and building mental constructions of these concepts
- memorize the functioning of the ac resistance bridge 370

tentative plan:
1. thenevin+northon thm
2. source transformation
3. summarize notes so far, write about it, mental constructions, what to memorize (loop-back method, calculations of thenevin emf and resistance)
4. two-terminal networks  application is for voltage divider, first-order filters, IV characteristics, wire resistance measurement 
5. ac current features
6. impedance, input/output impedance
7. lock-in amplifier

later:
- for practical considerations of RvT, see "measurement, instrumentation and sensors" book

**Questions**
- whats the difference between the amplification in a lock-in amplifier and an amplifier?
- whats a linear network?

- what does thenevin thm says?
- whats its physical meaning 
- how does it apply to circuits in the lab and measurement?
- look up measurement of input and output impedance using resistors
- i need better intuition of electrical circuits-->solve problems everyday
