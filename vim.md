# vim

what is vim?
text-editor, meaning that you can read and write files in plain text (in contrast to formatted text), i.e. there is no text structure, the file only contains lines

vim script

writing vim files-->files that vim can interpret and execute
eg. .vimrc file
--> vim ~/.vimrc

vim has its own scripting language-->vim script

*vim plugins*
plugin: vim script file that is loaded automatically when vim starts

im using "vim-plug" as a plugin manager, a plugin manager simplifies managing and downloading plugins by separating the plugins in different dir

go to ~/.vim/plugged to see what pluggins are installed
