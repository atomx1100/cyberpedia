# PLD

goal: write at least a page on pld

plan:
1. look at notes on system, draw system, write about system components
2. write procedure
3. outline of what to write about

maybe good idea to start with methodology first and then explain the process

dont have much math to accompany pld, mostly about processes involved and considerations for growth of oxides-->why is this? because use empirically, not doing research on it, and replace the missing math by characterization


write down all parameters of each component, just focus on listing the facts and then write 
making summarizing notes before writing to better organize the information

### questions
**laser**
- why pulsed laser?

**target**
- what is a target?


### report outline questions
- explain epitaxial and thin film?
