# PLD

goal: write at least a page on pld

plan:
1. look at notes on system, draw system, write about system components
2. write procedure
3. outline of what to write about

maybe good idea to start with methodology first and then explain the process

dont have much math to accompany pld, mostly about processes involved and considerations for growth of oxides-->why is this? because use empirically, not doing research on it, and replace the missing math by characterization

1. look at notes, organize notes

write down all parameters of each component, just focus on listing the facts and then write 
making summarizing notes before writing to better organize the information

1. list processes, list components, list parameters
2. find connections
3. figure out what to write
4. then can relate to methodology
5. why use the setup for growing oxides (why wavelength, etc)?

apply the pld theory directly to ybco to understand why the parameters are chosen and what effects dominate

1. finish writing on laser ablation
2. notes on plume expansion
3. write on plume expansion
4. write about laser 

### questions
**general**
- what do i care about pld in my research?

**laser**
- why pulsed laser?

**target**
- what is a target?

**vacuum chamber**
- why choose this base pressure?

**laser ablation**
- laser: whats the output of a laser?
- what happens in between pulses?
- how does electron-phonon coupling transfers heat to the target? (phonon, i.e. lattice vibrations, energy is related to the lattice temperature which is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the atoms) 
- what about photon-phonon interaction?
- what happens during evaporation
- laser absorption: what electrons are excited when the photons first interact with the electrons of the target material?
- for ultra short pulses, why do you also need a higher laser frequency?
- how does the plume size affects the growth? and the plume size is related to the spot size of the laser

**plume**
- whats the plasma plume composition? (see charles thesis p.55), plasma plume, so whats the composition of a plasma

### report outline questions
- explain epitaxial and thin film?
