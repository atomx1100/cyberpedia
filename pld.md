# PLD

goal: write at least a page on pld

plan:
1. look at notes on system, draw system, write about system components
2. write procedure
3. outline of what to write about

maybe good idea to start with methodology first and then explain the process

dont have much math to accompany pld, mostly about processes involved and considerations for growth of oxides-->why is this? because use empirically, not doing research on it, and replace the missing math by characterization

1. look at notes, organize notes

write down all parameters of each component, just focus on listing the facts and then write 
making summarizing notes before writing to better organize the information

1. list processes, list components, list parameters
2. find connections
3. figure out what to write
4. then can relate to methodology
5. why use the setup for growing oxides (why wavelength, etc)?

apply the pld theory directly to ybco to understand why the parameters are chosen and what effects dominate

1. finish writing on laser ablation
2. notes on plume expansion
3. write on plume expansion
4. write about laser 

### questions
**general**
- what do i care about pld in my research?

**laser**
- why pulsed laser?

**target**
- what is a target?

**vacuum chamber**
- why choose this base pressure?

**laser ablation**
- laser: whats the output of a laser?
- what happens in between pulses?
- how does electron-phonon coupling transfers heat to the target? (phonon, i.e. lattice vibrations, energy is related to the lattice temperature which is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the atoms) 
- what about photon-phonon interaction?
- what happens during evaporation
- laser absorption: what electrons are excited when the photons first interact with the electrons of the target material?
- for ultra short pulses, why do you also need a higher laser frequency?
- how does the plume size affects the growth? and the plume size is related to the spot size of the laser
- 

**plasma plume formation and expansion**
- whats the time scale of the process?
- whats the spatial distance of the vapour from the target?
- when is the vapour transition to plasma, i.e. gas phase-->plasma phase? is there some precise moment?
- how does the plume expansion affects the film growth?
- how does the kinetic energy of the plume affects the deposition?

background gas
- what pressure regime is the pressure used for ybco growth?-->200mTorr is at the bdy of the transition regime and diffusion-like regime
- the mass of the species in the target (important for plume)

**plume**
- whats the plasma plume composition? (see charles thesis p.55), plasma plume, so whats the composition of a plasma
- whats the shape of the plume and what determines it? 

### report outline questions
- explain epitaxial and thin film?


## to understand
- read chap.5 in eason
- what are the unwanted effects?
- compare the ablation rate with the deposition rate

plume formation and expansion

during pulse
1. material ejected (composition), initial vapour formation
2. knudsen layer and laser absorption (density, collision, ionization+electron heating, thermalized, different velocity)
3. expanding plasma, separation of charge, electric field, ions accelerated, electrons cant escape the plume
after the pulse
1. no more energy input to sustain plasma and material ejection
2. direciton of plume acceleration determined by initial plume direction, ions accelerated by double layer
3. acceleration rate decreases as the plume expand to asymptotically approach a constant velocity, plume expand with angular distr



material ejection (evapouration of the target material): electrons, ions, neutral atoms (ideal vapour composition) are ejected, i.e. free particles moving away from the solid, from the target material after the laser hits the target 
the ejected material have KE towards the substrate with energy comparable to their bond strength 
this makes up the inital vapour above the target

* can describe the ratio of ions to neutral atoms in the plume using the saha equatio which bridges the gap between a gas and a plasma since plasma is a gas of charged particles (ions, electrons)
  
*whats in practice in the vapour: more than one species (mix of molecules, atoms, ions, clusters, particulates-->see p.2309 in practical review)?*

*during laser pulse*
laser absorption of the initial vapour plume: the initial vapour coming from the target screen the laser beam partly resulting in the transfer of energy from the laser to the particles of the vapour, i.e. laser absorption, via photoionization and inverse Bremsstrahlung effect. The consequence of the laser absoprtion is an increase in the ionization of the vapour plume and an increase in the electron temperature

increase of vapour density correlated with increase in collisions in the vapour plume (*caused by what?*-->continuous material ejection) and electron temperature-->formation of an electrostatic double layer called Knudsen layer

expansion of plume (during the pulse): described by assuming a thermal equilibrium between the laser absorption in the vapour and the injection of species from material ejection of the target

*different phases of expansion*: 
1. initial expansion in a collisional manner (*why?*) contributing to increase in ionisation and charge separation
2. adiabatic expansion
3. 

plume expansion dependent on:
- size of ablation spot
- size of constituents ions
- background pressure

**Interaction of plume with background gas**
introducing a background gas means that the species of the expanding plume will collision with the gas

2 main effects of background gas:
collisions implies exchange of KE-->reducing the velocity of the plume (contrls the kinetic energy of the arriving species to the substrate)
and 
reaction with the species of the plume-->formation of molecules or cluster in the plume (incorporation of other elements to the film)
and 
incorporation of the gas molecules in the plume-->incorporation of other elements to the film

Effect on film growth:
- composition: incorporate new elements if the gas moleucles are reactive
- thickness: deposition rate by controlling KE of arriving species in plume 
  
dof/parameters:
- pressure-->change mean free path compared to target-substrate distance since if MFP<t-s distance-->little interaction going on
- gas species
