goal for tonight: write about XRR and XRD in masters report

## XRR notes

todo:
- map out the system and the parameters
- look at the bragg reflection equation and understand what it means 
-  

careful not to dig to deep in useless part

* why does the beam reflect of the sample? (index of refraction, density of sample)
* xrd for thin films vs crystals
* missing what the intensity is proportional to in xrd-->see structure factor
* see if there is not some simulation i can do of xrd peaks
* what are the features of the data? (intensity, angle, gaussian shape, etc)
* need to mention specifically what i do with the model im using
* what is diffraction? (xrd==x-ray diffraction) 
	* why is it that diffractions requires the wavelength to be of the order of the slit?
	* 
* why use x-rays? 
* why the peaks have a width, why not delta-fcn?
* what is the photon energy of the x-rays important for?
* what do the x-rays interact with when they are reflected?

masters report:
- starting from xrd machine, describe the functionning of the xrd machine, describe how data are acquired, describe what the data means
