mental habits

thinking about thinking and meta research, writing, developing rigorous ways to do research and for thinking **what am i getting at?**

the same old ideas, i should expose myself to new ideas (computer related, biology, engineering, math, etc) and try to fit them in my knowledge graph

in research, everything is a problem to solve


improving implies change,
my main problem to solve is how to make new behaviors, ways of thinking stick for some trial period-->in research a solution is the reminder and being patient in the lab 
this is basically a problem o fincreasing awareness and so gaining more agency in my decisions





you can just start doing stuff now, what is this mental block that gives a feeling of unpreparedness before doing something new, must be related to risk aversion-->learning barrier
similar to how i put barrier for thinking about stuff if the context is not right


*what am i feeling?* the goal is to notice both in the body and mind, one way to do this, is to diffuse my awareness throughout my body

clarity, being relaxed, energetic/overclocking my mind

keeping a list of projects to work on, the thing is that i get disinterested once i write down the idea, maybe it wasnt worth pursuing then

**building mental infrastructures**

straightforward solution vs surprising solution 

causality, structure, model, representation, patterns, interactions, state, system, information



## masters report

organize the information
write
how else could i do it? i expect to know what to write directly
or
simply write and iterate a lot (this might be good to counter the idea that i need to write something "perfect")

*knowing the level of abstraction at which im explaining*-->empirical, how varying the parameters affects the growth of the thin film, i.e. the outcome, and their relation to the processes
*it's all very causal*
system
parameters (charles put emphasis on target and substrate)
processes
outcome
methodology


level of abstraction and emphasis on practical knowledge, i.e. information that can be used to control the growth process
