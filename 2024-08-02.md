you can just start doing stuff now, what is this mental block that gives a feeling of unpreparedness before doing something new, must be related to risk aversion-->learning barrier
similar to how i put barrier for thinking about stuff if the context is not right


*what am i feeling?* the goal is to notice both in the body and mind, one way to do this, is to diffuse my awareness throughout my body

clarity, being relaxed, energetic/overclocking my mind

keeping a list of projects to work on, the thing is that i get disinterested once i write down the idea, maybe it wasnt worth pursuing then

building mental infrastructures

straightforward solution vs surprising solution 

recognizing john's limits
