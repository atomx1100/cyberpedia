causal model of experimental setup
functional model of experimental setup
physical model of the experimental setup (eg. for DS in XRD, the physics would diffraction if the slit width is of the order of the wavelength of the source)
-->layers of different models

functional model-->reverse engineer the idea, so starting from the goal that the system aims to achieve, think about how the system can be used to achieve the goal

**math and experimental physics**
mapping equations to the physics
knowing the mathematical functional relation of the variables in an expriment (eg. linear, exp, etc)

experimental system (instrument, technique):
- calibration 
- reference experiment (test for expected result of technique/instrument)
- resolution
- 

lacking the analysis part of what is observed in a measurement

---
i should look for what other type of characterization technique exist and what they do


not justifying the use of the nword
i dont understnad why you consider saying a word out loud when alone and thinking so differnet
what do you mean not mine to think about, how does that makes sense, are we not thinking about it right now, am i not to listen to music with the n word

she is saying something about human expeirence

it seems like you are thinking about it too widely, all im syaing is that 
what do you think of the thoguht of the nword when i listen to music, you cant control always whats in your mind, and what if the word is being repeated ni my mind, is that bad

arent you dictating how i people should be thinking about it by saying this?

im sorry you feel that way
the best i can come up with why you think that is that something something, women, india growing up

im gonna dump my thoguhts evne if i think it is pointless and you respond if you want

how do you come up with conclusion (the conclusion of being allowed to think about it) if you cant think about it in the first place

my answer was pretty shit, not very tactful, but it was how i thought best to express myself, i talked about it with my roomate and he made me realized it was pretty shit answer




i dont understand why you are saying how i, as an individual, think about it doesnt matter, i think thats beside waht im syaing
im not trying to justify the use of the nword, i realize what i wrote was badly expressed and im rambling too much
all im saying is that i dont see the difference between saying out loud alone and using my internal voice to repeat the lyrics
are you saying that i also shouldnt be singing along with my internal voice if the nword comes up in a song
