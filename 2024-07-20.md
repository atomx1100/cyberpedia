causal model of experimental setup
functional model of experimental setup
physical model of the experimental setup (eg. for DS in XRD, the physics would diffraction if the slit width is of the order of the wavelength of the source)
-->layers of different models

functional model-->reverse engineer the idea, so starting from the goal that the system aims to achieve, think about how the system can be used to achieve the goal

mapping equations to the physics
knowing the mathematical functional relation of the variables in an expriment (eg. linear, exp, etc)

experimental system (instrument, technique):
- calibration 
- reference experiment (test for expected result of technique/instrument)
- resolution
-
