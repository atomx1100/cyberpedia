**types of mental models to apply in experimental physics**
causal model of experimental setup
functional model of experimental setup
physical model of the experimental setup (eg. for DS in XRD, the physics would diffraction if the slit width is of the order of the wavelength of the source)
system model of experimental setup
-->layers of different models


functional model-->reverse engineer the idea, so starting from the goal that the system aims to achieve, think about how the system can be used to achieve the goal

**math and experimental physics**
mapping equations to the physics
knowing the mathematical functional relation of the variables in an expriment (eg. linear, exp, etc)
the goal is to be able to understand the instruments im doing experiments with in the lab, so how much "side" learning do i need to do? 

experimental system (instrument, technique):
- calibration 
- reference experiment (test for expected result of technique/instrument)
- resolution
- 

lacking the [analysis](analysis) part of what is observed in a [measurement](measurement)

**system model**
- instrument components 
- how it works (or what it does) vs function

explanation technique:
- start from initial state and final state and describe all the steps in between
- can understand the pattern of explanation in good textbooks to see get an idea of how to clearly explained concetps
- find for myself, whats the best way to go from understanding to explaining (eg. using mental constructions and pictures)
- using a causal sequence of arguments 

**arguments**
- refuting my ideas
- in textbook, understanding the sequence of physical and mathematical arguments proving a physical statement

### observations on writing masters report
- the act of writing and explaining is more difficult than you think when you mostly only take notes for yourself and read stuff without clearly writing what im learning

### learning techniques
- alternating between periods of accelerated and focused thinking and slower but more holistic thinking 

## characterization techniques
i should look for what other type of characterization technique exist and what they do





time
2-9 sleep
9-1030 morning
1030 lab
1800 stop
1820 home
1900-0100 physics

total=8h30+6h=14h30 of physics
i can probably succeed in doing 10h/day, trade 2 hours for gym
