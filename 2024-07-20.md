causal model of experimental setup
functional model of experimental setup
-->layers of different models

functional model-->reverse engineer the idea, so starting from the goal that the system aims to achieve, think about how the system can be used to achieve the goal


experimental system (instrument, technique):
- calibration 
- reference experiment (test for expected result of technique/instrument)
- resolution
