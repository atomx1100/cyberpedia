# reality

reality is not what it seems in that natural phenomenon are perceived with human senses but dont dont map to realtiy (eg. optical illusions)
we can to some extent accurately perceive reality by reasoning with the mind via mathematics but not with the senses, but the senses is also the mind in a way
